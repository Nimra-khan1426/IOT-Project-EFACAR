# IOT-Project-EFACAR
“The Emergency First Aid Caring Assistant Robot” is a mobile IoT-based robot designed for disaster area. It includes a Wi-Fi camera for live video streaming, communication ,gas sensors to detect harmful gases, a servo motor-controlled first aid kit, an LCD to show gas levels. It aims to deliver first aid to injured persons where human entry is risky.In today’s world, especially during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic where human contact must be minimized, automation plays a critical role in healthcare and disaster response. The Emergency First Aid Caring Robot is designed to provide medical support in hazardous situations where immediate human intervention is difficult or dangerous.

This ground-based robot combines robotics, IoT, and sensor-based automation to deliver emergency aid to victims quickly and safely. It is intended for use in disaster zones, industrial accidents, mining areas, and other high-risk environments.”
